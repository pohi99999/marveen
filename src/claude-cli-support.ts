// Which Claude model ids the INSTALLED Claude Code CLI can actually launch.
//
// Pure module, zero I/O: every decision is unit-testable without a binary.
// The measurement (running `claude --version`) lives in
// src/web/claude-cli-version.ts; this file only interprets its result.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (PICKERCLIKAPU923, measured 2026-09-23): the dashboard's
// model picker is a static list, and a customer install pins the CLI
// (install-linux.sh CLAUDE_PIN="2.1.110"). On that CLI, `claude-fable-5-1`
// and `claude-opus-5-5` answer HTTP 400 `unrecognized_model` on the FIRST
// prompt, while `claude-opus-5` and `claude-sonnet-5` run (positive control,
// same box, same run). Nothing in the launch path catches this: the session
// comes up, every prompt 400s in the pane, and the agent is silently deaf.
// The picker therefore has to know what the installed CLI can run.
//
// FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN: when the installed version is NOT measurable (binary
// not on PATH, probe error, unexpected output), no option is filtered. A
// customer who cannot pick any model is worse off than today; the caller
// shows a visible "unmeasured" label instead.

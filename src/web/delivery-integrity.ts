// PROMPTCSONK923: did the scheduled prompt ARRIVE the way it was typed?
//
// sendPromptToSession streams a prompt into the pane as ~80-char send-keys
// chunks. Anything else that writes the pane between two chunks -- a foreign
// Enter above all -- lands INSIDE the prompt. Measured 2026-09-23 on Claude Code
// 2.1.280 against an isolated probe session, using the real sendPromptToSession:
//
//   - one foreign Enter mid-stream SPLITS the prompt: the head (with the
//     opening <scheduled-task> tag) is submitted as its own message, the tail
//     arrives as a second message with no envelope at all -- exactly the shape
//     a customer reported (text starting mid-attribute, the provenance gate
//     flagging the agent's own task);
//   - a foreign C-u or Escape mid-stream silently drops characters from the
//     middle;
//   - typing into a BUSY pane, or into a TUI still booting, arrived intact
//     (4/4 boot deliveries, busy delivery queued whole).
//
// And the one real truncation on the reference install (2026-09-13 07:58:08Z,
// ledger-live-drain, 870 of 1750 chars, head gone) was the FIRST message of a
// fresh session: the task fired the same second channels.sh restarted it. It
// was not a busy-pane send, so the 'fired_busy' status (AUDITBORITEKVESZ918)
// missed it -- while it flagged the 2026-09-18 kanban-audit run, whose
// transcript holds the full 44448-char prompt, envelope and all.
//
// So pane state at send time is a proxy that is wrong in both directions. The
// only place that knows what the agent received is the session's own
// transcript: Claude Code writes every submitted prompt to its jsonl verbatim.
// This module compares that record with what was typed.
//
// Pure except readUserPromptsSince (file reads). Never throws.

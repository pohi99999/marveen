// ---- multi-envelope batch mates (B1F38C8C) ---------------------------------
// From the tick's snapshot, the OTHER pending inter-agent rows addressed to
// the head row's recipient, in ascending id, up to the recipient's cap. Each
// mate is re-read for liveness (same rule as the head: a row that is no longer
// pending at send time is not sent), classified and wrapped with its own
// envelope, trace-stamped, and given its OWN freshness suffix computed now --
// so an older row whose newer sibling rides in the same batch is annotated.
// `remaining` is the recipient's REAL pending count beyond this batch, read
// from the DB at compose time -- NOT the snapshot's leftover. The snapshot is
// `localPending.slice(0, MAX_MESSAGES_PER_TICK)`, a GLOBAL 25-row cap across
// every recipient, so a recipient whose rows fit the batch cap inside the
// snapshot can still have more rows past position 25; a snapshot-local count
// would then say "nothing else waits" from a truncated view. Measured by the
// reviewer (#1415): the pending set exceeded 25 in 38 separate episodes over
// 30 days, peak 43, i.e. exactly in the congested moments this feature is
// for. The DB count includes every still-pending row for the recipient
// (channel-inbound ones too: they wait in the same queue and arrive serially),
// and excludes rows that are no longer pending, so a mate skipped by the
// liveness check below is not counted as waiting either.

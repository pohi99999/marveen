// Measured on our install: this sweep used to run inside listKanbanCards(), i.e. on every
// READ of the board -- so the act of measuring the kanban changed the kanban. An audit that
// asked "what is on the board" archived cards as a side effect of asking, and the set it then
// reported was not the set that existed a moment earlier.
//
// Moving it here keeps the behaviour and drops the side effect: listKanbanCards() is now a
// pure read, and the archiving happens on a clock instead of on whoever happens to look.
//
// The danger in this change is the opposite one, and it is why the wiring is asserted by a
// test: if the sweep leaves the read path and is not started anywhere, KANBAN_ARCHIVE_DONE_DAYS
// becomes a silent no-op -- nothing fails, cards simply never archive again. That is the same
// failure class the card is about, only inverted.
//
// Hourly, not per-minute: the cutoff is measured in DAYS (default 30), so a finer poll would
// only add wakeups. The first pass is delayed like the neighbouring runners so boot is not a
// burst of work.

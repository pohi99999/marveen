// Reap orphaned channel-plugin pollers (bun/node processes that survived a
// tmux kill-session or are left over from a previous agent crash).
//
// The bug we close (2026-06-01 incident, channel-disconnect roundtrip):
//   - stopAgentProcess used `pkill -f TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR=<dir>`, but the
//     plugin process argv is just `bun run --cwd .../telegram/0.0.6 start`
//     - the env var lives in /proc-equivalent environment storage, not argv,
//     so `pkill -f` never matches and the orphan keeps polling getUpdates
//     with the same bot token until SIGTERM by hand.
//   - startAgentProcess only killed the tmux session pre-launch and did NOT
//     reap orphans at all. After a restart the old poller raced the new one
//     and Telegram returned 409 Conflict in a loop.
//   - The plugin writes bot.pid in <chanDir>/bot.pid. That works on the
//     happy path but if a new poller crashed and a later one overwrote the
//     file, the older orphan is no longer in bot.pid - we miss it.
//
// Strategy: combine two identifiers.
//   1. bot.pid (cheap, works for the supervised process).
//   2. `ps axeww` scan for the *_STATE_DIR=<chanDir> env-var match. This
//      catches orphans whose pid is no longer in bot.pid - any process that
//      was started against this channel state dir is in scope, regardless
//      of how its argv was rendered. macOS BSD ps emits each process's full
//      environment when invoked with `e`; we grep that.

//
// The env-var scan above answers "which processes were started against this
// channel state dir". For years that was the same set as "which processes are
// the plugin poller", because channels.sh launched the MAIN session withOUT
// exporting *_STATE_DIR -- a fact the comments in this file and in
// channel-monitor.ts still asserted. #915 changed it: channels.sh now exports
// the var (see scripts/channels.sh, "the plugin honours *_STATE_DIR, and with
// it exported the main session's poller does carry it"), and env vars are
// INHERITED. So the needle now also matches:
//   * the session's own `claude` process -- which on the main session IS the
//     tmux pane leader, so SIGTERMing it destroys the session, and
//   * every unrelated child that happened to inherit it, down to the watchdog's
//     own `sleep 5` inside scripts/channels.sh.
//
// Measured on this host 2026-09-21 06:55 (5 matches for one channel dir):
//   641057 claude  <- tmux pane pid of lean-chief-channels
//   641186 bun     <- plugin launcher      }  the only real pollers
//   641196 bun     <- bot.pid              }
//   668857 sleep   <- child of channels.sh (the watchdog's own sleep)
// and in the outage (03:00-06:31) the reaper killed all four of them, 40 times,
// every attempt taking the bridge down for the next 4-6 minutes.
//
// So the candidate list is now a SUPERSET of the pollers and must be filtered.
// Three independent guards, because the expensive failure is killing the
// session and the cheap failure is leaving one orphan for the next sweep:
//   1. pane        -- the pid IS a live tmux pane pid. Never killable here:
//                     that is an agent session, not a poller.
//   2. pane-ancestor -- an ancestor of a live pane (the tmux server, systemd).
//   3. claude      -- argv[0] basename is `claude`. An agent process, whatever
//                     its parentage; DETACHED ones are reapDetachedChannelClaudes'
//                     job, and that function identifies them by pane attribution
//                     instead of env/argv heuristics (see its comment).
//   4. not-a-runtime -- argv[0] basename is not a JS runtime. A channel plugin
//                     poller is always run by one (`bun run ...`, `node
//                     server.ts`); a `sleep`/`git`/`npm install` that merely
//                     inherited the env var is not. Applied to ENV-SCAN
//                     candidates only: bot.pid is written by the plugin itself,
//                     so a poller shipped as a compiled binary is still reaped
//                     through that path. The gap this leaves is narrow and
//                     named: a NON-JS orphan whose pid is no longer in bot.pid.
//
// The pollers themselves are descendants of the pane and are still reaped --
// that is the whole point of reaping BEFORE a respawn (a surviving poller
// 409-races the new one). Only the pane itself and its ancestors are spared.

//
// CORRECTED 2026-09-21 (card ee485f5e): the paragraph that stood here claimed
// the env scan "MISSES the main channels session entirely", because channels.sh
// launched the main `claude --channels` with no *_STATE_DIR export. That has
// been false since #915 -- channels.sh exports it, the plugin writes bot.pid,
// and the main claude and its bun poller BOTH match the needle. The claim was
// load-bearing: it was the reason reapChannelOrphans had no pane guard, and
// once it went stale the reaper started SIGTERMing the main session's own
// pane leader (measured: 40 times between 03:00 and 06:31 on 2026-09-21).
// reapChannelOrphans now filters its candidates (selectReapablePollers).
//
// What this function is still for: a detached `claude --channels` left behind by
// a --continue respawn. When a --continue respawn (channel-monitor
// respawn-pane / agent-process start) fails to tear down the prior claude, the
// detached claude survives -- reparented to the tmux server -- and keeps a bun
// poller hitting getUpdates on the SHARED bot token. 5 such orphans accumulated
// over 13 days, each 409-racing the live poller (token churn + a self-feeding
// agent thrash-restart loop). See project_channels_continue_respawn_leak.
//
// Identification is by tmux-pane attribution, NOT env/argv heuristics (cmdline
// alone cannot tell a live agent claude from a detached one -- see
// feedback_verify_session_before_kill): a `claude --channels` process is an
// orphan iff neither its pid nor any ancestor pid is a LIVE tmux pane pid.
//   - main session: tmux runs claude as the pane leader, so claudePid == panePid.
//   - sub-agents:   tmux runs `sh -c "...claude..."`, so the pane pid is the sh
//                   and claude is its child -> ancestor walk catches it.
// The tmux SERVER process is excluded up front: its argv embeds the full

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Foreign MAIN-token poller reaper (2026-07-18 incident: the main bot went
// silent for ~half an afternoon).
//
// The two reapers above share a blind spot that this one closes:
//
//   reapChannelOrphans          -> matches by <PROVIDER>_STATE_DIR=<chanDir>.
//     The MAIN channels session is launched by channels.sh with NO
//     TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR export (the plugin falls back to its default dir,
//     ~/.claude/channels/<provider>), so the main poller carries no state-dir
//     needle and is invisible to that env scan.
//   reapDetachedChannelClaudes  -> matches `claude --channels` processes not
//     attached to a live pane. A THIEF here is NOT a `--channels` session: it
//     is a plain local-agent-mode / CLI `claude` running in the project cwd,
//     which AUTO-LOADS the telegram plugin because the PROJECT settings.json
//     has enabledPlugins.telegram=true. Its argv has no `--channels`, so that
//     reaper never even considers it.
//
// Net effect: a local-agent-mode subagent (e.g. one the main session's own
// Agent/Task tool spawns) loads the plugin with the DEFAULT state dir, grabs
// the MAIN bot token, and long-polls getUpdates alongside the legit poller ->
// 409 Conflict -> the main bot silently drops inbound. The existing
// down-recovery restarts the VICTIM (the legit session), never the THIEF, so
// the outage persists until the thief happens to exit.
//
// This reaper targets exactly that class: a poller bound to the MAIN (default)
// state dir -- i.e. WITHOUT a <PROVIDER>_STATE_DIR override, which cleanly
// excludes every sub-agent -- whose owning `claude` process is NOT the pane
// leader of the main channels session. The legit main poller's nearest claude
// ancestor IS the channels pane pid; a thief's nearest claude ancestor is the
// local-agent-mode claude (a DESCENDANT of the pane, but not the pane leader).
// So pane-pid EQUALITY -- not mere descent -- is the discriminator (the thief
// is a descendant of the channels pane too, so an "ancestor includes pane"
// test would wrongly spare it).

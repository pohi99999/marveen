 * file-history-snapshot, artifact-autoreact-ledger) are written while a session
 * sits completely idle, and they carry NO `timestamp` field. The file therefore
 * keeps growing when nobody is working: measured on Willy's transcript, the
 * last real turn was 11:35:56 while mtime read 12:24:19 and was still climbing
 * (10404001 -> 10404348 bytes under observation).
 *
 * The consequence is not "the gate waits a bit longer". The restart gate blocks
 * while msSinceTranscriptWrite < transcriptQuietMs, so a signal that never goes
 * quiet is a gate that NEVER opens: Willy's was blocked 240 minutes with no
 * stuck work at all. The mtime measurement was never wrong about the FILE; it
 * answered a different question than the one the gate asks.
 *
 * Reads a bounded tail rather than the whole file: transcripts here run to tens
 * of megabytes and this is called on every gate tick. The first (likely
 * partial) line of the tail is dropped. Lines are JSON-parsed and only a
 * TOP-LEVEL `timestamp` counts, so an ISO date quoted inside message text
 * cannot masquerade as activity.

How heavy a guest have we been on each source? Read it BEFORE a fetch sweep.

Why this exists
---------------
On 2026-08-28 one free, public documentation site started returning 403 to
everything. It was not
broken and it had not changed its mind about the allowlist: we had taken 140 pages
off it in three days, 83 of them on 08-26 alone. It is a free, public source. We
used it up.

The shape of it matters, because two people described it two different wrong ways
before anyone measured it. It was NOT one fourteen-minute hammering, and it was NOT
two hours of sustained pressure either. Averaged over the span it is 0.4 requests a
minute, which is nothing: on 08-26 the traffic sat inside 22 distinct minutes out of
212, on 08-27 inside 14 out of 125. Roughly nine tenths of the window is silent, and
the rest is clusters of four to eight in a single minute.

So spreading the SAME number of requests over more hours would not have saved the
source. The binding number was the volume itself -- 83 pages in a day off one free
site -- with the bursts making it more visible. The remedy is to want fewer pages,
not to trickle the same ones more politely.

The rule that came out of it lives in the quarantine-reader's own prompt: behave
like a guest, no more than about a dozen pages from one host in a run. But that
rule is PER RUN, and the damage was not done in one run. It was done by a caller
spawning sweep after sweep, each one individually modest. A per-run cap cannot see
across runs, so it cannot stop what actually happened.

This closes that gap on the caller's side, where the whole picture is. It counts
what the egress gate already logged, so it is a measurement, not a good intention.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, and the number has to say so
------------------------------------------------
The egress gate is a PreToolUse hook matched on "WebFetch" and nothing else. Its
own header says it: it does not intercept WebSearch, curl or Bash network calls,
or MCP outbound. So this counts WebFetch traffic and only that.

Measured 2026-08-29: the roxy and cody profiles both carry Bash(curl:*), and
roxy's whole purpose is calling an outside image service. Those requests never
reach the log, so they never reach this tally -- and a clean report here would
mean "nobody used WebFetch heavily", not "we were light on that source".

That is the same failure this file already fixes one level down, where a
SELFTEST_ line would have vanished from the count in silence. A number that
quietly excludes things is worse than no number, so the scope is printed with
every report rather than left in a docstring nobody opens.

Usage
-----
  fetch-budget.py [--host HOST] [--days N] [--warn-per-day 40] [--warn-per-min 3]
  fetch-budget.py --budget HOST [--cap 12]      # may I fetch from it right now?

`--budget` answers the only question a caller actually has before a sweep: how many
pages have I already taken off this host TODAY, and how many are left. It reports
the remaining allowance and exits 1 when there is none, so a sweep can be gated on
it instead of on somebody remembering.

Exit code 1 if any host is over a threshold, so it can gate a step.

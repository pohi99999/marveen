# Retire the progress-indicator plumbing of a channel provider that is no
# longer in use. The exact inverse of install-<provider>-progress-hook.sh:
# it unwires the hooks from settings.json and stops+removes the watchdog
# daemon (systemd user timer on Linux, launchd agent on macOS).
#
# Why this exists: installing a second provider's progress hook does NOT
# retire the first one's. After a Telegram -> Slack migration both sets stayed
# wired, so every turn ran a dead telegram_progress.py, and a systemd timer
# fired telegram_progress_watchdog.py 1440x/day against state directories that
# no longer existed. Silent, permanent waste that nothing reported. Exactly one
# provider's progress machinery should be live at a time: the one in
# CHANNEL_PROVIDER.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/retire-progress-watchdog.sh telegram
#   bash scripts/retire-progress-watchdog.sh telegram --dry-run
#   bash scripts/retire-progress-watchdog.sh slack --force   # retire the ACTIVE provider
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run, exits 0 with "nothing to retire" when clean.
# The hook .py files themselves are left on disk -- they are inert once
# unwired, and re-running the installer restores the wiring.

#
# MEASURED 2026-10-07 after a power cut: launchd started the main session at
# 15:58:19 while DNS was not up yet. The co-listen Slack plugin's MCP connect
# failed after its 60 s limit ("getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND slack.com", Claude Code's
# mcp-logs-plugin-slack-channel-slack), Claude Code does not retry a failed MCP
# connect, and the owner's main channel stayed deaf for 30 minutes until a
# manual reconnect. Waiting here, before claude starts, costs nothing when the
# network is up (one lookup per host) and prevents exactly that boot.
#
# Bounded: after CHANNEL_NET_WAIT_MAX_S the session starts anyway (a host that
# never resolves must not keep the bot down forever) and the wait says so.

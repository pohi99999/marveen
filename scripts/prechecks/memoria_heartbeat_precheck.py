"""PRECHECKSZURO1004 -- preCheck for the memoria-heartbeat scheduled task.

The round reviews "what happened since the previous round" in the MAIN
agent's session. Measured on one install over 72 h (232 rounds): every round
that wrote a memory or a skill had either main-session tool calls or an
inbound message in its window; 131 rounds had neither and all 131 ended
"quiet". So: nothing happened since the last closing stamp -> nothing to
review. Only an EMPTY window counts: some productive rounds followed just 1-3
tool calls, so "little work" is not a safe signal.

Install-agnostic: the install root is this file's grandparent (scripts/
prechecks/ -> root); the main agent's transcripts are looked up under every
config root the dashboard itself considers (~/.claude, <root>/.channels-config,
MAIN_AGENT_CONFIG_DIR from the environment or <root>/.env), in the folder
Claude Code names after the root (every character other than a letter, a
digit or "-" becomes "-"). Activity in ANY candidate counts, so a wrong guess
can only make the round run, never skip it.

Contract (schedule-runner.ts runPreCheck): stdout "SKIP" skips the LLM round,
anything else (or a non-zero exit, a crash, a timeout) runs it. This script
FAILS OPEN: every error path prints nothing and exits 0, so the round runs.

Modes (file MODE_PATH, one word; absent = DEFAULT_MODE, unknown = shadow):
  shadow  never prints SKIP; only logs what it would have done.
  live    prints SKIP when the window is empty.
Every decision is logged as one JSON line to LOG_PATH, in both modes.

Safety net: if the last stamp is older than MAX_SILENCE_S, the round runs
regardless (a stamp that stopped being written must not silence the task).
A stamp later than now + FUTURE_TOLERANCE_S is an error state (a clock jump, a
restored snapshot, a stamp written in milliseconds): the activity window
[last, now] would be empty by construction and MAX_SILENCE_S could never fire,
so the round runs and the log says 'future-stamp'.

Paths are overridable by environment variables for the tests only.

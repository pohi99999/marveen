"""Audit [[wikilink]] references in the agent memory directory.

A naive "file does not exist -> broken" check conflates three different things,
and only one of them is a defect:

  MEMORY        the link resolves to a memory file (by filename or by its
                frontmatter `name:` field -- both forms are used in practice)
  MEMORY-SZEKCIO  the link resolves to a `## <slug>` section heading inside a
                topic collector. Consolidation merges a memory file into a
                collector and KEEPS its original slug as the heading, exactly
                so existing links keep resolving -- so this is a hit, not a
                defect. Measured 2026-09-15: 688 of 911 "unresolved" targets
                were of this kind, and the count grows with every
                consolidation round, not with any breakage.
  SKILL / TASK  a valid cross-namespace reference to ~/.claude/skills/<n> or
                ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/<n>. NOT broken. Existence is
                CHECKED here, never assumed from a hand-maintained list.
  ARTIFACT      prose that merely looks like a wikilink: POSIX character
                classes ([[:space:]]), placeholders ([[link]]), phrases.
  UNRESOLVED    none of the above -- the real repair queue.

A heading match tolerates hyphen/underscore drift (`a-b` vs `a_b`), which is
pure spelling, but NEVER strips the type prefix: `feedback_x` and
`reference_x` are different memories, so a prefix-blind match could resolve a
link to the wrong one. Prefix-only candidates go to their own SZEKCIO-PREFIX?
bucket for a human to look at -- not silently resolved, not dumped into the
repair queue.

Also reports name/filename drift, because a rename has to keep the filename,
the `name:` field and every [[link]] in sync; if they drift, the mixed-form
links that exist today get regenerated.

Usage: python3 scripts/memory-link-audit.py [memory_dir]

Findings never change the exit code -- this is a report, not a gate. An
unreadable or missing directory DOES fail loudly, on purpose: a silent empty
report reads as "all clean", which is the one failure this tool must not have.

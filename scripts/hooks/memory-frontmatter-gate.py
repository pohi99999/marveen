"""memory-frontmatter-gate.py -- PreToolUse gate for Write/Edit/MultiEdit on memory files.

WHY (MEMFMGATE918, 2026-09-18): nine memory files in the fleet store had a
frontmatter that did not parse (an unquoted `description:` containing ": ",
one broken double-quoted scalar). The harness reads `description` to decide
recall relevance, so those nine memories were RECALL-BLIND: on disk, and
therefore "remembered", yet never retrievable. "I wrote it" is not the same
as "it can be read back". This gate parses the frontmatter of the file AS IT
WOULD BE AFTER THE WRITE, in the same step as the write, and blocks when it
does not parse.

SCOPE: only `<...>/projects/<slug>/memory/<file>.md`, never MEMORY.md (the
index has no frontmatter). Any other path passes untouched.

CONTRACT (hook-exit-code-invariant): exit 2 = block, the stderr text goes
back to the model with the fix; exit 0 = allow. This gate NEVER exits 1:
malformed stdin or an unreadable file is not a verdict, so it allows.

PARSER: PyYAML when importable (that is what the fleet's audit used to find
the nine); otherwise a strict subset check that rejects exactly the two
measured failure shapes (unquoted scalar with ": " inside, unbalanced
double quote). The verdict names which parser decided.

"""Level-aware email approval gate for the MAIN agent (EMAILKAPU901 PR2).

Wired in the repo's .claude/settings.json (PreToolUse: Bash + *send_email* +
*manage_email*), i.e. for sessions rooted at PROJECT_ROOT -- the main agent.
Sub-agents keep their unconditional hard-deny (scripts/email-send-gate.mjs in
their own settings); a sub-agent session that also loads this hook is still
blocked by that one, so this gate can never widen sub-agent rights.

The `email_send.level` in store/autonomy-config.json becomes a real switch:
  level 1  -> hard deny (signal-only autonomy).
  level 2  -> CHECK-BEFORE-SEND: the send is allowed only against an APPROVED,
              UNCONSUMED, IN-WINDOW approval whose content_hash equals the
              sha256 anchor of THIS letter's envelope (to + cc + bcc + subject +
              body). A body+subject hash alone would let an approved letter be
              re-sent to a different recipient -- hence every recipient field, bcc included (msg 17936, EMAILBCCHORGONY903).
  level 3  -> allow (autonomous; the outgoing-copy-gate still audits copy).

At level 2 there is ONE narrow bypass, the standing recipient list
(store/email-standing-recipients.json, EMAILALLANDOCIMZETT926): a letter whose
sole recipient is on that list, with no cc and no bcc, is allowed without an
approval. It exists because the owner wants notifications to his own address
without clicking, and the alternative he was about to reach for -- raising the
level to 3 -- is far wider: the level knows nothing about WHO the letter goes
to, so it would also release every supplier letter. The list is checked only at
level 2; level 1 stays a hard deny, so "signal only" keeps meaning that.
Because that path authorises with no human deciding on THAT letter, it carries
two obligations the rest of the gate does not (review of #1608): it LEAVES A
TRACE the owner can read -- an append-only local log plus an entry in the
dashboard's daily log, and an unrecordable send is denied -- and the level-2
DENY MESSAGE does not name the list file or the way onto it. The old wording
did, and since the agent can write store/ itself, the gate's own refusal was
the manual for getting around it. The right to send still comes from the
owner; the route to it is no longer handed out by the thing doing the
refusing.
The list alone no longer grants anything (the review's third ask): an entry makes
an address a CANDIDATE, and a one-time, owner-resolved approval
(category email_standing_recipient, content_hash = sha256 of the normalised
address) makes it live. That approval is neither consumed nor time-windowed --
a standing right that expires or dies on first use is just a per-letter approval
under another name -- and the owner's LAST resolved decision wins, so a later
rejection revokes the right without anyone editing the file. Whoever can write
the list still cannot grant themselves the right; that separation is the whole
point, and it only holds where the approvals path is out of the agent's reach.

Anchor semantics (Marveen msg 17900, 5+1 conditions):
  1. the hash is computed from the SAME extraction the copy gate audits
     (email_extract.collect_email_envelope -- single implementation);
  2. an approval is ONE-SHOT: consumed atomically on allow;
  3. a TIME WINDOW (~30 min from approval) bounds the hash match;
  4. FAIL-CLOSED: unreadable letter, unrecoverable recipient, missing config,
     or unreachable approvals DB all DENY -- "cannot decide" never means
     "allowed";
  5. the deny message hands the agent the exact hash + a readable summary, so
     the approval's action_description is human-readable and the resend can
     only succeed with byte-identical content.

Exit codes (PreToolUse contract): 0 = allow, 2 = block. A crash must never
exit 1 (non-blocking) -- the __main__ net converts it to 2 on send paths.
EVERY malformed input (unparseable stdin included) blocks: unlike the copy
gate, which audits and stays alive on harness faults, this gate authorizes,
so "cannot decide" is always a deny.

# The standing list is the ONLY path on this gate that puts a letter on the
# wire without a human deciding on THAT letter. Its entire accountability is
# therefore the trace it leaves, and the trace has to reach the OWNER -- a
# systemMessage is read by the very process this gate exists to constrain, so
# on its own it is not a record, it is a receipt handed to the sender.
# Every approval-free send is recorded twice:
#   - locally, in an append-only log next to the list (last-resort record);
#   - in the dashboard's daily log, which is where the owner actually reads.
# The two failure modes are handled DIFFERENTLY, on purpose:
#   - a failed LOCAL append DENIES the send. It is a file append into the same
#     directory the gate just read the list from; if that cannot be done, the
#     send cannot be recorded at all, and an unrecordable approval-free send is
#     precisely the invisible hole this list would otherwise open.
#   - a failed DASHBOARD post does NOT deny. The owner's own notifications must
#     not hinge on the dashboard being up. Instead the local line says in words
#     that the owner was not reached, and so does the systemMessage, so the gap
#     is itself on the record rather than being the absence of one.

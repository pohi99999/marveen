"""Stop hook: ENFORCE that an inbound Telegram message is answered through the
reply tool before the turn ends.

Root cause this fixes: the "always reply on Telegram, never as plain tmux text"
rule lived only as passive context (CLAUDE.md + memory). Nothing MECHANICALLY
enforced it, so it recurred whenever the model's attention lapsed (classically
during long runs of plain-text heartbeat turns). This hook moves the rule from
"documented" to "enforced": the harness runs it on every Stop and blocks the
turn from ending while an inbound Telegram message is still unanswered.

How it decides (all data comes from the existing conversation_log ledger, so this
hook adds NO new state model -- it reuses ledger_lib.open_question_with_age):
  - open_question_with_age(agent_id) returns the most recent inbound that has NO
    later outbound (i.e. an unanswered message). ledger-outbound.py logs an
    'out' row on every reply-tool call, so a reply flips this to None.
  - If there is no open question -> allow the stop (exit 0, silent).
  - If the open inbound is a pure acknowledgement ("ok", "köszi", 👍, ...) -> allow;
    per the standing rule a bare ack needs no reply.
  - If the open inbound is older than STALE_SECONDS -> allow; never nag forever on
    an abandoned/old message (prevents an endless block loop).
  - If this same message_id has already been blocked MAX_BLOCKS times -> allow;
    a hard backstop so a wedged model can never be trapped in an infinite loop.
  - Otherwise -> BLOCK with a directive telling the model to send the reply via
    THIS install's channel reply tool (resolved from CHANNEL_PROVIDER; see
    _channel_provider) with chat_id=..., before stopping.

Safety: any error -> allow the stop (exit 0). A guard hook must never wedge the
session. agent_id is derived from the session cwd, so it is generic across all
channel agents and never cross-contaminates.

# Contract tests for scripts/main-inbox-observer.sh -- the OUT-OF-PROCESS
# observer of the main agent's pending inbox.
#
# Why the observer exists:
# the main agent's queue is the one delivery path nothing watches from outside
# the dashboard process. message-router.ts:539 `continue`s for MAIN before the
# abandon window, so a main-agent row is never failed and never raises a
# handoff-failure alert; inbox-nudge-watcher.ts is the only thing that reads
# getPendingMessages(MAIN_AGENT_ID), and graphify puts it inside web.ts ->
# index.ts, i.e. the very process whose death is the failure mode.
#
# Driven through `main-inbox-observer.sh --check <db>`, which evaluates a
# database and exits BEFORE any alert, stamp or state write -- so these run
# from fixtures with no live install, no bot token and no Telegram.
# Exit codes: 0 = ok, 1 = stalled, 2 = unknown (unreadable queue).
#
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/main-inbox-observer.test.sh

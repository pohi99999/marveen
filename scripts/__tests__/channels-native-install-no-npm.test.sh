# Contract tests for the Claude Code install/update block in scripts/channels.sh
# on hosts that use Anthropic's NATIVE installer.
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-17): a host that had migrated to the native installer
# (~/.local/bin/claude -> ~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>) still ran the daily
# `npm install -g` from channels.sh, which re-created a SECOND, independent claude
# under the npm global prefix. The main session then came up on the npm copy
# (2.1.274) while the rest of the fleet ran the native one (2.1.265). Two installs
# on one machine is the vector that had already broken the install four times in
# one day in July.
#
# What is pinned:
#   1. native host, launcher present      -> npm is NOT called (update skipped)
#   2. native host, launcher missing       -> relinked to the newest version, npm NOT called
#   3. non-native claude, stale stamp      -> npm IS called (daily check unchanged)
#   4. no claude and no native versions    -> npm IS called (self-heal unchanged)
#   5. STALE native leftover (versions/<old> only, no launcher) on a host whose
#      npm package is installed            -> npm self-heal IS called, NO relink
#      (review #1613: a leftover must not pin the host to an old CLI and switch
#      its updates off for good)
#   6. launcher symlink left DANGLING into the versions dir (its version was
#      removed)                            -> relinked to the newest, npm NOT called,
#      even with an npm package present (the launcher is the stronger evidence)
#   7. npm race AFTERMATH: stale versions/<old>, no launcher, no npm package dir,
#      but an npm update stamp NEWER than the newest native build
#                                          -> npm self-heal IS called, NO relink
#      (review #1613 round 2: the missing package is the crash, not a native host)
#   8. same shape, but the stamp is OLDER than the newest native build
#                                          -> relinked, npm NOT called
#      (the stamp check must not switch the native self-heal off)
#   The version dirs of 7 and the stamp of 8 are backdated with `touch -t`:
#   `-nt` compares whole seconds on macOS bash 3.2, so files written in the
#   same second would make case 7 silently relink.
# 3, 4, 5 and 7 are the positive controls: the guard must not switch the npm path
# off for hosts that really are npm installs.
#
# Version fixtures include 2.1.9, 2.1.30 and 2.1.265 so that a lexical sort, or
# picking the first instead of the last, selects a wrong version (sort -V pin).
#
# The block is extracted from channels.sh (from `CLAUDE_UPDATE_STAMP=` up to the
# `CLAUDE="$(command -v claude)"` line) and run against a throwaway HOME, with
# `npm` stubbed on PATH to record every call. Nothing touches the real system.
# Negative control: CHANNELS_BIN=<pre-fix channels.sh> makes cases 1 and 2 fail.
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/channels-native-install-no-npm.test.sh

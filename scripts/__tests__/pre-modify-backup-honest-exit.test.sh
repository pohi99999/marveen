#!/bin/bash
# Contract tests for scripts/pre-modify-backup.sh -- the checksum tool and the
# exit code. Run: bash scripts/__tests__/pre-modify-backup-honest-exit.test.sh
#
# Two defects, measured on a macOS install the first time the script ran:
#   1. `sha256sum` is GNU coreutils and does not exist there, so every manifest
#      line was written with an EMPTY checksum column -- 26 paths, 0 sums. The
#      manifest exists for one purpose, comparing the live tree after an update
#      or a branch switch, and without sums it can only prove existence.
#   2. Eighteen "command not found" lines went to stderr, and the script then
#      printed "backup ok" and exited 0. The card asking whether to SCHEDULE
#      this script was open at the time: a scheduled caller reads the exit code,
#      so every round would have looked perfect while the drift check silently
#      did not exist.
#
# Hermetic: everything runs against a throwaway repo, never the live store. The
# "no checksum tool" case is produced by a curated PATH containing symlinks to
# the commands the script needs and nothing named sha256sum or shasum.

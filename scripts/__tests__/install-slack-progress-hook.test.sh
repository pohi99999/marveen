# Contract tests for scripts/install-slack-progress-hook.sh
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/install-slack-progress-hook.test.sh
#
# Mirrors scripts/__tests__/install-telegram-progress-hook.test.sh. Verifies:
#   (a) does NOT source the .env file (no `set -a; . .env` pattern)
#   (b) does NOT fail when .env contains an unquoted value with spaces
#   (c) does NOT execute code from a $(...) value in .env
#   (d) correctly reads SERVICE_ID / BOT_NAME with and without quoting
#   (e) falls back to defaults when .env is absent
#   (f) MAIN_AGENT_ID fallback when SERVICE_ID absent
#   (g) #1305 contract: writes NOTHING under ~/.claude -- no hook copies, no
#       user-global settings.json edit -- and points the watchdog unit at the
#       REPO copy of slack_progress_watchdog.py
#   (h) the three settings hooks are repo-shipped in the tracked project
#       .claude/settings.json ($CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR form), so there is nothing
#       for the installer to wire
#   (i) installing Slack retires the Telegram progress hooks
#   (j) provider gate: CHANNEL_PROVIDER=telegram -> installs NOTHING and
#       retires any leftover Slack hooks (sync-hooks runs every installer)
#   (k) provider gate: missing / unknown CHANNEL_PROVIDER resolves to telegram
#   (l) a failing retire (own leftovers in the gate, the other provider's before
#       an install) is printed and reaches the exit code -- never `|| true`'d
#   (m) hermeticity: no unshimmed installer run, and (on a Mac) no testbot job
#       registered with the host's launchd after the suite
# (g), (i) and (j) run once per daemon branch: [Linux] systemd, [Darwin] launchd.
#
# All filesystem operations use a fully isolated temp tree -- the real
# ~/.claude directory and the real INSTALL_DIR are never touched. The full-run
# cases feed the installer a temp .env via MARVEEN_ENV_FILE (the installer's
# test hook) so they do not depend on whatever the checkout's own .env says.
#
# EVERY installer run goes through run_installer, which puts PATH shims for
# launchctl / systemctl / pidof in front. Both service managers act on the
# real user domain whatever $HOME says: before this, only case (g) was
# shimmed, and on a Mac cases (i) and (j) registered a REAL launchd job
# (com.testbot.slack-progress-watchdog) from the temp plist, which outlived
# the suite and kept firing against a deleted path. uname is shimmed as well
# (FAKE_UNAME), so the launchd branch AND the systemd branch both run wherever
# the suite does -- a macOS-only defect can no longer hide on Linux, or the
# other way round.

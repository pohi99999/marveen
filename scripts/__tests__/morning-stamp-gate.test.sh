# Contract tests for the morning briefing's same-day dedup stamp.
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/morning-stamp-gate.test.sh
#
# Bug being locked out (observed 2026-09-13): the stamp recorded "the process
# exited 0", not "the owner got the briefing". The 07:27 run refused its own
# task (its config dir carried no channel allowlist, so the reply tool rejected
# the owner's chat_id), printed an explanation, exited 0 -- and stamped the day
# as delivered. The guard then suppressed every retry and the owner got nothing.
#
# Fix under test: the run must print the per-run sentinel on its own line,
# which it is told to do ONLY after a reply tool call actually succeeded. No
# sentinel means no stamp, so the next trigger tries again. The sentinel
# carries a per-run nonce (MORNTIMERPARK914): a fixed constant is a control
# trigger that matches its own instruction text, so a run that merely QUOTES
# the instruction on a bare line would stamp an undelivered day.
#
# Hermetic: `claude` is a stub on PATH, and the script runs against a throwaway
# INSTALL_DIR, so nothing is sent and the real store/ is untouched. The stub
# extracts the actual sentinel from the prompt it receives -- the tests must
# not know the nonce in advance, exactly like a real run.

set -u

# Hermetic (#1555 review round 1): inside an agent session the inherited
# channel state dir points at a live access.json / bot token.

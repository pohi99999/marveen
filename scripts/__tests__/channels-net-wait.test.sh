# Contract tests for the network wait before the main session starts
# (BOOTSTAGGER1007 (a), scripts/lib/channel-net-wait.sh).
#
# Origin (measured 2026-10-07): after a power cut launchd started the main
# session before DNS was up; the co-listen Slack plugin's MCP connect failed for
# good ("getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND slack.com") and the owner's main channel stayed
# deaf for 30 minutes. channels.sh now waits (bounded) until the primary and
# every co-listen provider's host resolves.
#
# Driven through channels.sh's test seams (--channel-wait-hosts,
# --channel-net-wait), so a mutant copy of the script can turn this red via
# CHANNELS_BIN. The resolver is replaced with CHANNEL_DNS_PROBE except in the
# "real resolver" block, which runs the actual node/python3/getent chain of the
# host it runs on (macOS locally, Linux in CI).
# Run: bash scripts/__tests__/channels-net-wait.test.sh

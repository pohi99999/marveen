"""Boot-time hook sanity check: prune stale hook commands from settings files.

Scans ~/.claude/settings.json and agents/*/.claude/settings.json.
Any hook command that references a path under a volatile tmpfs directory
(/tmp, /var/tmp, /private/tmp, /dev/shm) OR a path that no longer exists on
disk is removed from the hooks block. A path behind $HOME / ~ (and, in an
agent's own settings file, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR) is resolved first; a path that
only resolves when the hook runs (relative, or behind any other variable) is
kept. The original file is backed up as <file>.bak before any modification.

Exit codes:
  0 -- scan completed (with or without pruning)
  non-zero -- unexpected error reading/writing a settings file (printed to stderr)

Environment variables:
  HOME        -- locates ~/.claude/settings.json and resolves $HOME / ${HOME} / ~
                 in hook commands (default: os.path.expanduser)
  INSTALL_DIR -- project root; agents are searched under $INSTALL_DIR/agents/

# Out-of-process observer for the MAIN agent's inbox queue.
#
# THE HOLE IT COVERS. Every other delivery path in the fleet is watched by
# something: a sub-agent's queue is failed by the router after
# MESSAGE_ABANDON_WINDOW_MS and raises a handoff-failure notice. The main
# agent's queue is not. message-router.ts:539 `continue`s for MAIN *before* the
# abandon check (the PULL model: tmux-injecting the perpetually busy channels
# session once wedged delivery for ~1h), so a main-agent row is never failed and
# never reported. The only reader of getPendingMessages(MAIN_AGENT_ID) is
# inbox-nudge-watcher.ts -- and `graphify affected` puts that inside
# web.ts -> index.ts, i.e. the dashboard process itself. When that process is
# down or wedged, the watcher is down with it, and mail addressed to the main
# agent sits pending with nobody to notice.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE UNIT -- the two cheap in-tree candidates both failed their
# measurement:
#   1. the hourly heartbeat summary is a setTimeout in src/index.ts (initHeartbeat
#      from main()), i.e. the SAME process. It dies with the thing it would
#      report on.
#   2. scripts/watchdog.sh is architecturally external, but nothing in the
#      repository registers it: it needs a crontab entry, a launchd plist or a
#      systemd unit that no install step creates, and `graphify affected
#      scripts/watchdog.sh` finds no callers either. Its own logs/ directory,
#      which it mkdir -p's on every single run, is the cheapest way to tell that
#      it never ran. An observer put there would never fire, which is the same
#      defect as the router-tick watcher that was already measured and reverted
#      (f73f0c1, 887be1b).
# The one mechanism PROVEN to fire outside the dashboard process is the launchd
# StartInterval / systemd timer pair used by the channel keepalive probe: a
# registered unit that keeps advancing its own stamp file on its configured
# period, with a zero exit status, while the dashboard process is untouched.
# So this script is installed the same way
# (scripts/install-main-inbox-observer.sh, scripts/systemd/main-inbox-observer.*)
# and reads the queue the only independent way there is: SQLite, directly.
#
# It alerts over the DIRECT Bot API (scripts/lib/send-telegram.sh), never over
# /api/* or the MCP plugin -- both of those die with the process this observer
# exists to outlive.
#
# It also stamps store/.main-inbox-observer on EVERY run. Without that stamp the
# observer could quietly join watchdog.sh in never running, and its silence
# would be indistinguishable from a healthy queue.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/main-inbox-observer.sh            # one tick (launchd/systemd)
#   scripts/main-inbox-observer.sh --check DB # evaluate DB, print, exit; no writes
#
# Exit codes of --check: 0 = ok, 1 = stalled, 2 = unknown (queue unreadable).
#
# Env:
#   MAIN_AGENT_ID                     - whose inbox to watch (default: .env, then marveen)
#   MAIN_INBOX_STALL_SECONDS          - stall threshold (default 1800)
#   MAIN_INBOX_OBSERVER_DB            - queue database (default <install>/store/claudeclaw.db)
#   MAIN_INBOX_OBSERVER_ALERT_DRYRUN  - if 1, print "ALERT_DRYRUN: <msg>" instead of sending

# Read one row without writing to the queue, through python3's stdlib sqlite3
# module. Not the `sqlite3` command-line tool: that binary is not an install
# dependency (install-linux.sh asks for ffmpeg, git, tmux, lsof, curl, python3,
# pipx and unzip), and on a host without it every tick read as verdict=unknown
# -- an observer that cannot observe. python3 is a dependency, and the fleet's
# own code (intel_db.py, ledger_lib.py, memoria_heartbeat_gate.py) already
# opens this database that way. Output keeps the CLI's list shape
# ("count|oldest"), so evaluate_queue below is unchanged.
#
# Two opens, in this order, because a READ-ONLY OPEN ALONE CANNOT READ THIS
# DATABASE IN THE ONE CASE THAT MATTERS: the queue is in WAL mode, and SQLite
# deletes the -wal/-shm pair when the last connection closes. A stopped
# dashboard therefore leaves a WAL-mode file with no -shm, and a read-only open
# cannot create one -- measured 3/3 (sqlite3 CLI -readonly, macOS) as "unable
# to open database file (14)", i.e. verdict=unknown exactly when the dashboard
# is down, which is the situation this observer exists for. Whether it fails is
# environment-dependent (the Linux CI runner opened the same fixture fine); the
# order below is right either way.
#
# So: try the strictly read-only open first (mode=ro -- it is right whenever it
# works and cannot touch anything, and it never creates a missing file), and
# fall back to a normal open with query_only=ON. Measured on that fallback:
# content and mtime unchanged by the SELECT, and a DELETE through the same
# connection is refused with "attempt to write a readonly database". It does
# create the -wal/-shm pair next to the file, which the next dashboard start
# uses as its own. If even the fallback fails (an unwritable directory, say),
# the caller keeps verdict=unknown -- honest, because at that point the queue
# really cannot be read. The caller checks that the file exists first, so the
# normal open never creates an empty database either.

# agent-msg.sh -- reliable inter-agent message send for the Marveen fleet.
#
# WHY: the common `curl -s ... >/dev/null && echo sent` pattern is DANGEROUS -- curl exits 0 even when
# the server REJECTED the request (401/400/5xx), producing a SILENT send failure: the recipient never
# gets the message and two agents can wait on each other forever. The /api/messages router itself is
# fine (HTTP 200 + a message id); the bug is that the SENDER never checks the result. This helper checks
# the HTTP status AND the returned message id, and RETRIES on failure. A message counts as sent only
# when an id came back.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/agent-msg.sh <from> <to> "<content>"
#   content: plain text (quotes / newlines OK) -- the body is built with json.dumps (no quoting pitfalls).
#   large / multi-line content may come from STDIN when the 3rd arg is "-":
#     echo "<long text>" | bash scripts/agent-msg.sh <from> <to> -
# Output: success -> "OK id=<n> queue=<depth> (~<n> min)"; failure -> "FAIL <reason>"
#         + a line in store/agent-msg-failures.log, exit 1.
#   The queue fields come from the POST response: a message is accepted instantly
#   but only DELIVERED into an idle gap in the recipient's pane, which on a busy
#   agent was measured at 80+ minutes. "queue=" is the recipient's pending count
#   including this message; "(~n min)" is the median delivery delay of its recent
#   messages and is OMITTED when there is no history (unknown is not "instant").
#   Both are absent against a server that does not return them, so the line is
#   then exactly "OK id=<n>" as before.
#   At MARVEEN_QUEUE_WARN_AT (default 3) or more waiting, a stderr notice says so
#   at the moment the sender decides whether to send the next one.
#
# LOG FORMAT, store/agent-msg-failures.log (tab-separated, one line per failure):
#   <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>  FAIL  from=<a>  to=<b>  url=<endpoint>  http=<code>  resp=<first 200 bytes>
# CHANGED 2026-09: the `url=` field is NEW. It was added together with the
# env-overridable base URL, because from that point a failure can mean "posted to
# the wrong address" and the old line could not distinguish that from a dead
# server. A parser written against the pre-2026-09 format sees one extra field;
# parse by the `key=` names, not by position.
# Env:
#   MARVEEN_API_BASE   full base URL, e.g. https://marveen.example.com (overrides host+port)
#   MARVEEN_WEB_PORT   port for the default localhost base (default 3420)
#   MARVEEN_TOKEN_FILE bearer token file (default <repo>/store/.dashboard-token)
#   MARVEEN_HOMOGLYPH_BIN  the checker (default <repo>/scripts/lib/homoglyph.py)
#   MARVEEN_QUEUE_WARN_AT  queue depth that triggers the stderr notice (default 3, 0 = off)
# MEASURED 2026-09-13: a remote agent runs this helper OUTSIDE this repo, where localhost:3420
# does not exist -- it had to fall back to raw curl, i.e. exactly the unchecked pattern this file was
# written to eliminate. A hardcoded base URL silently un-installs the helper for everyone not on this
# VM, so the base is env-overridable and the two endpoints stay ONE script.

# --- Homoglyph gate, BEFORE the payload is built (MSGGATE924) --------------
# On the RAW text, not on the JSON: json.dumps escapes a Cyrillic letter into
# \uXXXX, and a checker reading the encoded body would be looking at a string
# where the problem is no longer visible as a letter. The gate has to see what
# the sender typed.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN EACH AGENT'S TOOLBOX. Measured 2026-09-24 across
# three agents: two had built this guard for themselves, independently, because
# both had been bitten by it; the third had no guard at all. And no CLAUDE.md
# prescribes those private wrappers -- they all name THIS helper. The result was
# predictable in hindsight: the agent who WROTE such a wrapper spent a whole day
# calling this script directly, with the check run beside it in a separate
# command instead of in front of it. One message went out contaminated while the
# checker printed "NEM KULDOM EL" next to it. The rule that needs remembering is
# not a rule; it has to sit in the path of the action.
#
# FAIL-OPEN ON A MISSING CHECKER, AND LOUDLY -- a deliberate exception to the
# repo's usual fail-closed stance for gates (see .git/hooks/pre-commit.d). This
# helper is the fleet's mandated message route: blocking every inter-agent
# message on an install whose lib file is absent would be a far worse failure
# than the one being prevented, and it would be a NEW failure, not today's. A
# missing checker is exactly today's state, so the honest behaviour is to send
# and say so. Contaminated text with the checker PRESENT is refused, which is
# where the closed direction belongs.
# Overridable so the suite can measure the missing-checker branch too.

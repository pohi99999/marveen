# install-main-inbox-observer.sh
#
# Installs the launchd twin of scripts/systemd/main-inbox-observer.timer
# (macOS). Without this unit the out-of-process observer of the main agent's
# inbox (scripts/main-inbox-observer.sh) never runs, and the queue keeps the
# property this exists to remove: mail addressed to the main agent can sit
# pending forever with nothing outside the dashboard process to notice.
#
# The unit is what makes the fix real. scripts/watchdog.sh is the cautionary
# case: it documents a cron line in its own header and nothing ever installs it
# -- no crontab entry, no plist, no systemd unit anywhere in the repository, so
# it can sit at zero runs indefinitely.
#
# Period parity with the systemd timer:
#   OnUnitActiveSec=5min  -> StartInterval 300
#   OnBootSec=2min        -> RunAtLoad true (launchd has no boot-delay knob for
#                            agents; an immediate first run is safe -- the tick
#                            is read-only apart from its own stamps)
#
# Five minutes against a 30-minute stall threshold leaves six ticks inside one
# threshold window, so a single missed tick can never delay the alert past it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install-main-inbox-observer.sh            # install, do not start
#   scripts/install-main-inbox-observer.sh --load     # install and start
